# Console Clock with Real-Time Movement

This C# console application displays a digital clock with a double-bordered box around it. It allows real-time movement of the clock display within the console window using keyboard inputs (up, down, left, right).

## How to Use

- Use the arrow keys to move the clock display within the console window.
- Press the ESC key to exit the application.

## Additional Features

- Hold the left and right arrow keys to make horizontal movement faster.
- The application beeps when a valid 'arrow' key is pressed and plays a different sound when an invalid key is pressed.
